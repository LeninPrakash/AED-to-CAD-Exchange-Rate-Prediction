# AED-to-CAD-Exchange-Rate-Prediction-with-Linear-Regression


Description:

In this personal project, I'm using code from a GitHub repository to forecast the exchange rate percentage between the United Arab Emirates Dirham (AED) and the Canadian Dollar (CAD) using linear regression. I've collected and analyzed 20 years of historical data from investing.com to provide insights into potential future movements of this exchange rate.

Key Features:

Data Collection: I've gathered historical exchange rate data spanning two decades, ensuring a rich dataset for my analysis.

Data Preprocessing: I've conducted thorough data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure high-quality, accurate input for the model.

Linear Regression: The predictive model is built on the foundation of linear regression, a simple yet effective machine learning technique for predicting continuous numerical values.

Performance Evaluation: I assess the model's performance using various evaluation metrics, providing transparency about its accuracy and reliability.

Visualization: The results are presented through interactive visualizations, making it easier for me to interpret and understand the predictions.

Why This Project Matters:

Exchange rate predictions are crucial for personal financial planning and investment decisions. This project empowers me with insights into potential AED to CAD rate changes, allowing for better personal finance management and investment planning.
